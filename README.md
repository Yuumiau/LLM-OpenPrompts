**LLM-OpenPrompts** is a public repository containing a wide variety of prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series and other Generative AI (like Midjourney). The aim of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of prompts that facilitate various task automations using LLMs, ranging from simple Q&A to complex problem-solving.

This repository is being built upon. Many things are subject to change.
